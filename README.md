What Drives the Price of a Car?

In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. My goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of my analysis, I am going to provide clear recommendations to my to a ficticious used car dealership as to what consumers value in a used car.


## Summary of findings

 1) The single most important factor that influences a car's price by far is the car's year. The newest is the car, the more expensive it tends to be. Likewise, the older the car is the less expensive it tends to be.
 2) Other factors that also contribute to a car price - in order or importance - are odometer, cylinders, type of fuel, drive and type.
 3) The lower odometer is the more expensive the car tends to be. The more cylinders the car has the more expensive it tends to be. Diesel cars are usually more expensive than hybrid cars or gas cars. 4 wheel drive cars are also more expensive followed by rear wheel cars and forward wheel cars. Lastly the type of car also influences in the car's price for instance trucks are more expensive than hatchbacks.
 4) There are also a few things you must be aware that might decrease (at least not increase) the car's price. Avoid cars with colors silver, grey, orange, brown, blue and green.

### Final recommendation and Next Steps

The recomendations above should help you build an inventory that customers would be willing to pay more. However, I would strong advise you as a next step to analyze also what kind of car provide you the most profit. Neither the cost paid for the car nor the profit made on selling the car were found in the data shared, therefore, even though those are the cars that customer would be willing to pay top dollar it does not necessaryly means the biggest profits for your company.
